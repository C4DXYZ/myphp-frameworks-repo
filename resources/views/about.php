  <h3>About Page</h3>
  <p>This page is the about page. We are require to write this page because this is part of the laravel page. This page
 should be at least twenty sentences. If this page is not twenty sentences then it will not qualify as the about page. Now I am writing this page thinking what is the next sentence to write. I decided to write this sentence because i don't know what else to write in the next part of the paragraph. This is the seventh sentence and the next sentence will be the eigth I'm pretty sure of that because it comes before the nineth sentence. So now I'm still thinking what to write in this part of the paragraph. I want to write something about this page that make sense but I don't have any idea right now so I'll just go with the flow of what runs through my mind. I guess twenty sentences is pretty tough for those people who is not into writing. I think the best part of this page is that the writer doesn't know what to write after each sentence, it's sort of a free style writing or typing or whatever you may call it. In my humble opinion copy-pasting is the easiest to deal with this type of page. At this very moment in time I am hoping that I'm almost in the twentieth sentence but I think I need to count it first. So for now I'll pause for a while and start counting the sentences I've wrote. This is the fourteenth sentence, well I'm not really sure because I'm kinda confuse counting while looking for the period of each sentence. About page is the page where you should write something about what the page is all about. I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing but I don't want to stop writing because I need twenty sentences for this page. Laravel is an awesome framework that is the reason why we're on this page right now. I need a closing remark on this page. I will just simply say goodbye about page this is the end of you I am going to put the period now. </p>
